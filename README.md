# Finance Wrapped 🎧💸

Finance Wrapped is a personal finance insights project inspired by Spotify Wrapped.
It transforms raw bank statements into easy to understand spending insights, trends,
and summaries making personal finance more engaging for Gen Z.

Finance Wrapped converts bank statements (CSV) into:
